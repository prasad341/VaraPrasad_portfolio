# Project 1 : AIR POLLUTION FORECASTING AND DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING 

.  In this project we can predict the pollutants in air by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm.

.  When the PM(Particulate Matter) is high, it causes serious issues on people's health. 

.  Where the system attempts to predict the PM2.5 level and detect air quality based on the data set consisting of daily atmospheric conditions in a specific city.

# Models For Forecasting

.  Linear regression is a Supervised Learning algorithm which goal is to predict continuous, numerical values based on given data input.

.  Linear Regression tries to find parameters of the linear function, so the distance between the all the points and the line is as small as possible

.  Algorithm used for parameters update is called Gradient Descent 

# Features
