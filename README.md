# Project 1 : AIR POLLUTION FORECASTING AND DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNINGÂ 
# In this project we can predict the pollutants in air by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm.
# When the PM(Particulate Matter) is high, it causes serious issues on people's health. 
# Where the system attempts to predict the PM2.5 level and detect air quality based on the data set consisting of daily atmospheric conditions in a specific city.
